# C Programming Assignments – CSE102

This repository contains C programming assignments completed as part of the  
**CSE102 – Computer Programming** course.

All assignments are organized under the `C-/CSE102_Homeworks` directory.  
Each assignment folder includes:
- The original assignment description (PDF)
- A corresponding `main.c` implementation

## About the Assignments

The assignments in this repository were given throughout the semester and are
designed to assess problem-solving skills under predefined constraints such as
restricted language features, strict output formats, and file-based input/output
requirements.

Each assignment is independent and was implemented according to the rules and
specifications provided in the original assignment documents.

## Assignments Overview

- **Assignment 2**  
  A simple 2D grid-based game where the player moves using keyboard inputs.
  The game state is stored in a file and progresses across multiple executions.

- **Assignment 3**  
  A virtual ATM simulation that supports balance checking, depositing, and
  withdrawing money with persistent account data stored in a file.

- **Assignment 4**  
  A rocket trajectory simulation based on a quadratic motion equation,
  including text-based graph visualization and file export of results.

- **Assignment 5**  
  A terminal-based Battleship game with randomly placed ships, hit/miss tracking,
  and game logging using external files.

- **Assignment 6**  
  A number guessing (codebreaker) game with configurable rules, dynamic memory
  allocation, scoring logic, and detailed game logs.

- **Assignment 7**  
  A Minesweeper game implementation featuring recursive cell revealing,
  undo functionality using a stack, and move history tracking.

- **Assignment 8**  
  A data processing assignment that applies sliding window operations and
  user-selected aggregation methods to numerical data read from a file.

- **Assignment 10**  
  A basic question answering system that uses binary embeddings and XOR-based
  matching to retrieve the most relevant answers.

## Notes

All programs were compiled and tested using the compiler and compilation
standards specified in the assignment descriptions.
